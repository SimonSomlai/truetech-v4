Awesome Follow Up Reminder Email!

Hey there you incredibly sexy beast in the future <(^.^)>! Time to do a scheduled follow-up with <%= @title %>! It has been <%= @time %> since you've last contacted them :O.

Here's some things you could consider;

-Check out the website and update the plugins. What is something that could be improved?
-Call!
-Ask for a status update or things they'd like changed/improved?
-B2B: idea that could help advance their business/something educational
-What are some ways they could improve their marketing? What are their competition doing?
-Share something amusing/personal interest (cartoon?)

Historic greetings!

- Organized Simon from the past.
