How to Make an E-paper Quote Display

<img src="./header.jpeg">

‚ÄôTis the holiday season. 

Oh boy oh boy.

Time to get together with family, enjoy some nice meals and exchange some gifts. 

Happy times!

If you're still looking for a cool gift for your (nerdy) friend, I just might have the solution for you!

A fancy <b>e-paper quote display</b> to display all the random stuff you can think of! 

Quotes? - check!

Jokes? - double-check! 

That picture of your grandma you love so much? - triple-check!

Let's dive in ü§ø.

# What you‚Äôll need

- 7.5 inch/19cm e-paper display. ([I got this one](https://www.waveshare.com/7.5inch-e-paper-hat.htm)). There are also bigger, higher resolution and multi-colored displays but those tend to get really üí∞üí∞üí∞, fast.
- Raspberry pi zero 2 W ([I got this one](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/)). You can also get the one with pre-soldered headers if you don't feel like doing it yourself.
- Picture frame ([I got this one](https://www.action.com/nl-be/p/fotolijst38/)). The screen will be 17X11cm, so you'll just have to find something slightly larger.
- Micro SD card (8GB+ is ideal)
- Micro usb charging cable
- 2X20 Pin header + Soldering station/skills (unless you got the pi with pre-soldered headers)

<b>Total project cost: +-80‚Ç¨</b> or about 0,016 camels üê´.

# And we‚Äôre off..

Sooo...

The first thing you‚Äôll need to do is <b>setting up your raspberry pi hardware</b>. You do this by soldering the headers onto your raspberry pi. After that you can just plugin the e-Paper Driver HAT on top of it and you should be good to go.

The final result should look something like this;

After that‚Äôs done you can follow this really handy youtube tutorial to help you setup the software;

## Some additions

- You can also add multiple wifi configs to the wpa_supplicant.conf file. This way you can move your pi around between the home/main office and it‚Äôll automatically work there as well.

```sh
country=BE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="SSID1"
  psk="PW1"
}

update_config=1
network={
  scan_ssid=1
  ssid="SSID2"
  psk="PW2"
}
```

- I also wouldn't do the static ip part if you plan on moving the raspberry pi between locations. You can find the ip address of you pi by;

```sh
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

# Making it come alive üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Once that‚Äôs done you can start importing several python example scripts to test the display. The most basic one that you can try out is [this repo](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper) provided by waveshare electronics themselves. So you can clone the repo;

```sh
git clone https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper
cd e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python
```

And then some basic install commands for the libraries you'll need;

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
sudo pip3 install Jetson.GPIO
```

After this you‚Äôll be able to run some basic example in the  the examples  directory

```bash
python examples/epd_7in5_V2_test.py
```

And if all went well you should see the standard waveshare demo springing to life on your screen. This looks something like this;

Congratulations! ü•≥

Now you can start making changes to whatever you want to have displayed on the screen. I decided I wanted to have some jokes displayed from [JokeApi](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/). I basically copied the example script and started from there.  

I used the [FTP simple VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humy2833.ftp-simple) to easily change the files on my pi. Here's the full code;

```py
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding:utf-8 -*-
import sys
import os
picdir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))), 'pic')
mediadir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))), 'media')
libdir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))), 'lib')
if os.path.exists(libdir):
    sys.path.append(libdir)

    logging.info("ctrl + c:")
    epd.epdconfig.module_exit()
    exit()

````

Now to finish it up, You can schedule it with a cronjob to update at whatever interval you want. This will update the screen once every hour.

```sh
0 * * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'python /home/pi/e-Paper/src/examples/quotes.py'
```

Now all that's left is to put it int a nice picture frame and hot-glue your raspberry pi to the back. Aand..

Tadaaa! üßôüê∞üé© You're done!!

# Conclusion

This makes for some really nice decoration for your desk and will significantly increase the # of laughs you'll have per day, so it's definitely a worthwhile investment. Also makes for a fun gift (I think :p)

Off-course it can be extended to display whatever you want;

- Movies 
- Jokes
- Quotes
- Images
- Cartoons
